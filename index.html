                    Leon Aharonian recently graduated from Columbia University with a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
                    As an active member and project leader on his High School FIRST robotics team he developed a strong foundation for teamwork and gained experience with CAD,
                    machining and assembly of national championship worthy robots. He also spent 2.5 years working at Columbiaâ€™s Robotics and Rehabilitation Lab where he
                    created a comfortable Posture Monitoring Shirt (PoMS) that used Machine Learning to generate posture-defining coordinate transforms based on electrical
                    resistance from stretch sensors. He also taught a 35 student summer enrichment course at his high school on the basics of CAD and 3D design.

                    At Columbia he contributed to several design projects. For his robotics studio course he built a walking bipedal robot out of printed PLA and laser cut acrylic and
                    programmed its servos to run off a Raspberry Pi. As a research student in the Creative Machines Lab he designed a data pillow for the elderly to monitor their vitals 
                    and notify emergency services if needed. He worked in a team to design, build, and control a complex linkage mechanism to press arcade buttons in sequence as quickly 
                    as possible. He also worked on several coding based design projects for digital manufacturing such as programmable embroidery and food printing. And Finally, he played 
                    a key role in the design and fabrication of DEMI.

                    In his free time Leon loves to ski, whitewater kayak, and escape into nature for adventures. He has also worked as a raft 
                    guide and video boater on class 3-4 whitewater.
