                    In the healthcare industry, it is becoming harder to find long-term economic solutions for
                    personalized elder care. Nursing staff cannot reasonably be expected to monitor a patient at
                    every hour of every day. Yet, demand for full-time care is unyielding. Autonomous solutions are
                    starting to be explored.

            The purpose of this project is to passively and non-invasively monitor a patient’s health
            while they sleep. The idea is to embed sensors (and a microcomputer) in a patient’s bed pillow
            that record vital signs throughout the night. The data taken are fed into an algorithm that
            assesses the overall health of the patient. If there is a reason to suspect that a patient is not
            healthy, the microcomputer alerts a human contact. The end goal is to have a pillow and
            machine learning model powerful enough to accurately monitor a patient’s health and, in the
            case of an emergency, save precious minutes by contacting medical services as soon as
            possible.

                    As of May 2023, four sensors have been implemented into a physical prototype. First, a
                    microphone. A microphone allows for the pillow to monitor the patient’s breathing patterns and
                    detect any anomalous noises, such as coughing or exclamations of pain. Second, there are
                    several force sensitive resistors (FSRs) arranged in a grid on the pillow’s surface. These
                    function as pressure sensors to detect the presence and position of the patient’s head on the
                    pillow. Third, there are the thermistors; these detect changes in temperature and, if calibrated
                    correctly through software, may provide readings of a patient’s body temperature. The
                    trimesters are attached to tin foil (a material that has high thermal conductivity) to maximize their
                    surface area. Lastly, there is an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that detects the movement of
                    the pillow across six axes.

                    In the future, there is room on the pillow for an ultra wideband (UWB) radar module. This
                    would allow for a noninvasive method of detecting human presence in a room without relying on
                    the pressure sensors or the microphone. Low-frequency pulses allow the UWB module to map
                    out a small space roughly the size of a bedroom. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a
                    UWB module this semester.

                    All of the embedded sensors have been tested using a data acquisition (DAQ) board.
                    The FSRs and thermistors function as voltage dividers, so changes in voltage in an analog input
                    viewer can be converted into usable data. The microphone connects via USB and the IMU is
                    compatible with Python, so a small microcomputer (such as a Raspberry Pi) would be sufficient
                    for data collection. The next steps of this project would be to improve the wiring of the sensors
                    on the pillow and to write software to better interpret the data readings from the pillow. Then, a
                    machine learning algorithm could be trained using this data to detect the physical responses of
                    certain health conditions, such as night terrors or seizures. Finally, a user interface could be
                    developed to better serve the needs of specific patients.
